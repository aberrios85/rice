# Rice - Rust ICE Implementation
A partial [WIP] Rust Implementation of [RFC8445](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8445])

# :rotating_light:First Rust Project:rotating_light:
This is my very first Rust project, so the code is likely to be have a few :bug: and likely not idiomatic Rust, so please throw some PRs where this can be improved.

# Work in Progress
:construction:
This is a project I started in order to learn Rust by attempting to implement something useful :) It is a purely spare-time project.
